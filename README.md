# PayWhere

PayWhere is an Android application that helps mobile payment users to
find suitable dining outlets in shopping centres by displaying those
that accept their preferred mobile payment platforms.

PayWhere contains all the information you need to dine and make payment
easily, so you don't have to trawl through multiple websites. We have
included the F&B outlet name, unit number and mobile payment platforms
accepted in an easy-to-use and elegant interface.
